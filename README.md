# Text-Based Adventure Game & Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool

This repository contains two simple C programs: a text-based adventure game and a Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool.

## Text-Based Adventure Game

### Description

The text-based adventure game allows players to make choices to progress through a story. Players will navigate through different scenarios, make decisions, and encounter various outcomes.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):




3. Run the game:



4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool

### Description

The Caesar cipher tool can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher algorithm. Users can provide a text and a key (shift value) to perform encryption or decryption.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

3. Run the tool:


4. Choose between encryption and decryption, and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Usage

- **Text-Based Adventure Game:** Follow the prompts to make choices and explore the game's storyline.

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool:**
- Select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt text.
- Enter the text you want to process.
- Provide the encryption/decryption key (an integer).
